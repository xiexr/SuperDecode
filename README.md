# SuperDecode
An integrated toolkit for mutation analysis. SuperDecode provides three useful modules, including DSDecodeML, HiDecode, and LaDecode, each tailored to automatically decode mutations from Sanger, high-throughput short-read, and long-read sequencing data of target-site amplicons, respectively.
