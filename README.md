# SuperDecode
An integrated toolkit for mutation analysis. SuperDecode provides three useful modules, including DSDecodeMS, HiDecode, and LaDecode, each tailored to automatically decode mutations from Sanger, high-throughput short-read, and long-read sequencing data of target-site amplicons, respectively. SuperDecode is a stand-alone software package that can be easily used in different computer systems.
## How to obtain the soft package?
We provide soft versions for Windows, macOS, and Linux. You can download the package based on your computer system.
### Windows
You can download the win package from the latest release ([SuperDecode_win.zip](https://github.com/xiexr/SuperDecode/releases/download/win.v1.0/SuperDecode_win.zip)). .  
After you download the binary file, please unzip it to your local disk (attention: ensure that no space or Chinese characters contained in the directory path).   
Click the "SuperDecode.exe" in the directory to start the program.  
For convenience, you can send a shortcut of "SuperDecode.exe" to Desktop.  
### macOS
The macOS version can be downloaded from the the latest release ([SuperDecode_mac.tar.gz](https://github.com/xiexr/SuperDecode/releases/download/macOs.v1.0/SuperDecode_mac.tar.gz)). .  
Unzip the binary file to your local disk. Please check that no space or Chinese characters contained in the directory path.  
To use it, click the "SuperDecode.exe" in the directory to start the program.
### Linux
We provide the Linux version (command line) for you.  
You can download the Linux excutable files from the latest release ([SuperDecode_linux.tar.gz](https://github.com/xiexr/SuperDecode/releases/download/linux.v1.0/SuperDecode_linux.tar.gz)).   
Unzip the tar.gz file to your local disk (using command: tar -zxf superdecode_linux.tar.gz). Ensure no space in the path.  
An example script is provided in the directory for you to run the test example data of each tool.
#### Alternatively, you can download the package via Cowtransfer (link:[https://tbtools.cowtransfer.com/s/d69cdec128f64e](https://tbtools.cowtransfer.com/s/d69cdec128f64e)).
#### SuperDecode can also be accessed from the plugin store of TBtools.
We also provide a web-based version of SuperDecode, which can be accessed via the link: http://www.crispr-ge.com/superdecode/

## How to use SuperDecode to analyze mutations?
SuperDecode provides three modules: DSDecodeMS, HiDecode, and LaDecode. Each module has distinct advantages.  
DSDecodeMS: decoding mutations from Sanger sequence chromatograms.  
HiDecode: high-throughput mutation analysis from NGS data of pooled amplicons.  
LaDecode: long and accurate mutation analysis from long-read sequencing (TGS) data of pooled long-amplicons.  
We provide detailed expermental procedures and package usages for each module.  
Please refer to the "SuperDecode_document.pdf" (in English and Chinese).
